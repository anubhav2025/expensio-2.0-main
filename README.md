# Expensio

Expensio is an advanced finance management application that helps users gain deep insights into their financial behaviors and expenditure patterns. Initially developed as a monolithic application, it is being improved and also being transitioned to a microservices architecture for better scalability, maintainability, and resilience. The user service is complete, and work is ongoing on the expense service.

This is an ongoing project.

1. **User Service**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL: Completed with rate-limited OTP Authentication.
2. **Expense Service**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB: Main Functionalities implemented with scope for improvements.
3. **Kubernetes**: In the infra/k8s directory, deployments for user and expense services are managed along with other important infrastructure details.
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: RabbitMQ added for asynchronous communication and implementing the SAGA pattern for distributed transactions.

## Features

### **OTP Authentication with Rate Limiting**

- **Secure OTP Generation**: Generated one-time passwords (OTPs) that are unique and difficult to guess, ensuring secure user authentication.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements a rate limiting mechanism to restrict users to a maximum of 3 OTP requests within a specified time period. This prevents abuse and reduces the risk of brute-force attacks.
- **Account Lockout**: After exceeding the OTP request limit, the userâ€™s account is temporarily blocked from requesting further OTPs. This feature helps mitigate potential misuse and enhances security.
- **Real-time Verification**: Processes OTPs in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users during the authentication process. This ensures a smooth and efficient user experience.
- **Reset and Recovery**: Allows users to request a new OTP after the lockout period expires, with mechanisms in place to notify users about the reset process and any related actions needed.

### **Event-Driven Architecture with RabbitMQ**

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Implements RabbitMQ for asynchronous message passing between microservices, improving decoupling and service independence.
- **SAGA Pattern**: Utilizes the SAGA pattern to manage complex distributed transactions across multiple services, ensuring data consistency and enabling reliable rollback mechanisms.
- **Message Queues and Exchanges**: Configured RabbitMQ with direct, topic, and fanout exchanges to handle different messaging patterns, providing flexibility and control over message routing.
- **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**: Integrated DLQs to capture and manage failed messages, enhancing the reliability and fault tolerance of the system.
- **Event Logging and Monitoring**: Implements detailed logging and monitoring for all events and messages, allowing for easy troubleshooting and performance tracking.

### **Shared Library for Reusable Code**

- **Centralized Middleware**: Offers reusable middleware functions for authentication, logging, and error handling, ensuring consistency and efficiency across services.
- **Error Handling Utilities**: Provides common utilities for managing and formatting errors, standardizing error responses across different services.
- **Configuration Management**: Includes shared configuration settings and constants to maintain uniformity and minimize code duplication.
- **NPM Registry Integration**: Registered the library on npm for easy installation and updates, ensuring all services use the latest code version.

### **Migration Scripts for PostgreSQL**

- **Database Migration**: Provides migration scripts for transitioning the database schema and data between versions.
- **Version Control**: Tracks and manages database schema changes using version-controlled migration scripts.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures data integrity during migrations by validating and transforming data as needed.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Supports rollback mechanisms to revert changes in case of migration failures.
- **Automated Execution**: Automates the execution of migration scripts to streamline database updates and reduce manual effort.

### **Docker and Kubernetes Deployment**

- **Containerization with Docker**: Uses Docker for containerizing application components, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: Leverages Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing containerized services, enhancing scalability and reliability.
- **Automated Deployment**: Facilitates automated deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and minimizing deployment errors.
- **Resource Management**: Manages resources efficiently, optimizing performance and cost-effectiveness in cloud environments.
- **Scalability**: Enables horizontal scaling of services based on demand, ensuring the application can handle varying loads.

### **Error Validation and Logging**

- **Robust Error Validation**: Implements comprehensive validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid inputs.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Provides user-friendly error messages to guide users in correcting issues effectively.
- **Error Tracking**: Tracks and logs error occurrences over time, helping identify and address recurring issues.
